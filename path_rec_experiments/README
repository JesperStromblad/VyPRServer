# Path Reconstruction Experiments for VyPR2

In this directory can be found scripts used for path reconstruction experiments.

`path_rec_test.py` - running `python path_rec_test.py -h` will give you information about how to use the command line interface.

The purpose of this script is to reconstruct paths up to observations generated by a certain instrumentation point in the verdict database,
and intersect them.
