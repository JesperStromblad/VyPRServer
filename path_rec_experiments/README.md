# Path Reconstruction Experiments for VyPR2

In this directory can be found scripts used for path reconstruction experiments.

These scripts are not really in any official release of VyPR, so they're not wrapped up yet in nice and easy-to-follow tutorials.
That's something for the future.

`path_rec_test.py` - running `python path_rec_test.py -h` will give you information about how to use the command line interface.

The purpose of this script is to reconstruct paths up to observations generated by a certain instrumentation point in the verdict database,
and intersect them.

For this script to work, you'll have to get a version of VyPR (verdict server + test web service) running.  Follow instructions in these notes:
